## 📖 About The Project

The anime industry has a massive and highly engaged global community that generates a vast amount of data across various platforms. This project aims to harness that data by building an end-to-end analytics pipeline.

Our goal is to create a system that can:
* Collect and process data from multiple sources (e.g., review sites, social media).
* Analyze this data to uncover trends and public sentiment.
* Use these insights to power a smart recommendation system for fans.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the project.

## ✨ Core Components

This project is structured around four key modules:

1.  **📊 Data Pipeline:** The foundation of the project. A scalable pipeline to ingest, clean, and store data from sources like MyAnimeList, AniList, and social media platforms.

2.  **📈 Trend Tracking:** An analytical module to monitor the real-time popularity and discussion velocity of various anime series, identifying seasonal hits and hidden gems.

3.  **💬 Sentiment Analysis:** A Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine to analyze reviews and comments, determining the overall community sentiment towards specific titles.

4.  **💡 Recommendation System:** A machine learning model that provides personalized anime recommendations to users based on their viewing history and nuanced data from the pipeline.

* **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Apache Spark (for scalability)
* **NLP / ML:** Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB / Elasticsearch
* **Frontend / Visualization:** To be decided (e.g., React, Streamlit, or Dash)
